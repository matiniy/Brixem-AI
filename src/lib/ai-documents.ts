## Total Project Estimate
**Range:** $72,650 - $145,950  
**Recommended Budget:** $110,000

## Timeline Estimate
- **Total Duration:** 10-12 weeks
- **Start Date:** TBD based on permit approval
- **Completion:** TBD based on start date

## Assumptions and Notes
- Costs based on current market rates in ${location}
- Estimates assume standard construction methods
- Prices may vary based on material choices and finishes
- Additional costs may apply for:
  - Design changes during construction
  - Unforeseen structural issues
  - Premium materials or finishes
  - Expedited timeline

## Risk Factors
- **Material Price Fluctuations:** Â±5-10% due to market conditions
- **Weather Delays:** Potential for 1-2 week delays
- **Permit Processing:** Timeline dependent on local authorities
- **Supply Chain Issues:** May affect material availability

## Recommendations
1. **Budget Planning:** Plan for the upper end of the estimate range
2. **Timeline:** Allow 2-3 weeks buffer for unexpected delays
3. **Materials:** Lock in material prices early when possible
4. **Insurance:** Ensure adequate coverage during construction
